# Tripwires

A way to define custom Alert mechanisms.

Automata lets users define their own way of alerting. Currently, following types are supported:

1. Slack
2. Discord
3. Email
4. Telegram

Each type requires relevant setup information. Once properly created, alerts with desired content can be issued to your tripwires.

## Alert

When a Tripwire is triggered, an Alert is issued to the destination services attacked to the Tripwire.
