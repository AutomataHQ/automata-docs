# Templates

Step Templates are the way to store your oftenly used Step Definitions.

Certains Workflow Steps are always common, and will be often **part of Multiple workflows**.

To **avoid Re-Defining** these common steps, Users can publish them as templates and later these can be referenced while defining Steps.

Choosing a published template will pre-populate required components of your Step automatically.


### Candidate Steps for Templatization:

1. Common Utilties like Merge, Diff Files.
2. Steps for common tools used in your workflows.
